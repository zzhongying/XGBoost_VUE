# Investigating the evolution of XGBoost in the Decision-Making Process of Android Malware Classification
## Abstracy
With the increasing number of Android devices, labeling malicious apps which are variants of an existing family is important for identifying new threats and determining the severity of the threat. As an integrated algorithm in machine learning, XGBoost is an important means to extract behavior features of malware and predict attack types. Understanding the decision basis and analyzing the evolution process of decision tree are the key factors to improve security expert's recognition in the XGBoost model. In this paper, FP-Growth algorithm is used to extract the association rules among security features and the results of FP-Growth are used to explore the malware behavior. We use “central class” to analyze the trend of error samples, the matrix decomposition algorithm is used to assist the optimization of feature engineering. Inspired by interpretative visualization,integrating the feature matrix, decision bubble view and other visual components, we propose a visual analysis system, VISXGB, aiming at interpreting prediction process of XGBoost model.To demonstrate the effectiveness of our system, two usage scenarios and a qualitative user study are conducted.
